# delve

This is a partial import of github.com/go-delve/delve/pkg focusing
primarily on DWARF utilities. The most important part copied over is
the stack program interpreter, though the regnum package is useful too.

Copied at commit e6e7aeb667057ad6a98120ebf3591fbafdedb19d, with additions to support DWARF5.
